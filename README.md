# Hangman-Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This simple yet entertaining game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start playing.

2. **Game Rules**: Guess the word by selecting letters. You have a limited number of guesses. Each incorrect guess will bring you closer to losing the game.

3. **Win or Lose**: You win the game if you correctly guess all the letters in the word before running out of guesses. If you exceed the maximum number of incorrect guesses, you lose.

4. **Try Again**: Don't worry if you lose! You can always play again by refreshing the page.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the game interface.
